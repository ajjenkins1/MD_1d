# MD_1d
Py scripts for 1d harmonic oscillator and diatomic vibrational spectrum.

Forms an assignment for graduate students that I have used in the past. Step-by-step details are given in Assignment.pdf.

1d_MD.py, input.dat        # starting point, harmonic oscillator, integrates with Euler 

These scripts represent the intermediate steps in the assignment, and can be used to check your progress.

1d_MD_verlet.py            # addition of velocity Verlet integration

morse_pes.py               # script to fit Morse potential to pes

1d_MD_verlet_pes_simple.py # simplest Morse pes script for students

1d_MD_verlet_pes.py        # Morse pes with nicer inputs
